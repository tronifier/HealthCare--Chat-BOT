***Analysis  System:*** -The analysis  system consists of a dataset for all hospitals of India which helps in finding ways to 
decrease the increase of major diseases in future and hence decreasing the graph of increasing deaths.This Data Set is made in python.
 
We have created a chat-bot to help persons and it does the following things: 

Team has decided to use AOG(Actions On Google/Google Assistant) because it can be easily accesed and can be found in every smartphone.
The app will be a multilanguage chatbot on AOG platform which speaks multi languages as per user needs.

a)  ***Free Health Camps:*** - It provide information to people about the nearby health camps in their area.
    So that they can locate them on map and reach easily and get their checkup done.

    immediately connect them to blood donors from where they can get blood. 


c)  ***Instant Remedy***- Suppose a person have a hearth attack  so the other person near him can immediately ask our chatbot
    “what to do during heart attack “ .Our chatbot would guide him step by step  so that he can saves the life of person.
